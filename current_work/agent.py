ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

To modify the code so that only one tool is used, which accepts an integer output to determine the retrieval method (1, 2, or 3), we can simplify it. The agent will output a single integer to determine which path to follow, based on the query's requirements. Here’s how to achieve this:

    Simplify the decision-making logic by using a single function, choose_path, that accepts an integer (1, 2, or 3) and uses the agent's response to determine the correct action.
    Implement the updated agent logic to decide based on the new criteria provided.

Here’s the modified code:

api_key = 'AIzaSyB_ic4AmBCWeFGnhV4WcVyU9GKPRRVQTyc'

instructions = """You are a helpful assistant, capable of retrieving and summarizing information by using a single function that accepts an integer to decide the retrieval approach:

    choose_path Function: This function interprets the integer result and selects the appropriate response path.
    Direct Answer Path: For path 3, the code includes an option to use model.get_response to generate the direct response when no retrieval is needed.

this is an excpetion? Question was how to solve World Hunger

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

Yes, it looks like the model encountered an exception or an incomplete response when trying to handle the question. The content "2\n```tool_code\nprint(default suggests that the model intended to return path 2 (indicating that external sources and uploaded documents may be needed to answer the question), but it cut off unexpectedly, likely due to a token limit or other constraint.

To resolve this issue:

    Increase max_tokens in the model configuration. Sometimes, complex responses require more tokens than initially allocated.

    Error Handling: Implement a check for incomplete responses or errors in the code to handle cases where the model fails to provide a complete path integer. For instance, you could set up a fallback response if the model’s output is incomplete or has unexpected content.

Here’s a modified version of the loop with added error handling:

python

while True:
    user_query = input("Enter your query: ")
    try:
        path_response = agent.send_request(user_query)
        path = int(path_response.content.strip())  # Clean and convert the response to an integer
        
        # Proceed based on the path returned
        response = choose_path(path, uploaded_doc_names=["doc1.pdf", "doc2.pdf"], query=user_query)
        print(response)
        
        if path == 3:
            # For direct responses, invoke the model directly
            res = model.get_response([{"role": "user", "content": user_query}])
            print(f'\n\nResponse: {res}')
            
    except (ValueError, AttributeError) as e:
        # Handle cases where the response is incomplete or non-integer
        print("An error occurred or incomplete response received. Please try again or refine your query.")

This way, if the model doesn’t return a clear integer path, the system will prompt an error message, allowing you to troubleshoot or adjust parameters as needed.

finish_reason='length

what is the meaning of this? Question was What is the capital of France?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

The "finish_reason='length'" in the model’s response means that the output was cut off due to reaching the maximum token limit set for the response, rather than naturally concluding the answer.

In the context of your question, "What is the capital of France?", this is likely unexpected since a short answer like "Paris" should fit well within typical token limits. This could indicate one of the following:

    Token Limit: The maximum tokens set for the model response (max_tokens) may be set very low, causing the response to end prematurely even for short answers.

    Incomplete or Unstructured Response: Sometimes, if the model starts a longer response or additional context, it may quickly hit a length limit. Setting a slightly higher max_tokens value or giving more concise instructions to keep responses brief might help prevent this.

To resolve it, try increasing max_tokens to a higher value (e.g., max_tokens=20 for short factual responses) to avoid the cutoff in such cases.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

The two ModelResponse outputs you provided illustrate different types of response terminations in a language model interaction, specifically "finish_reason": "stop" and "finish_reason": "length". Here's a breakdown of each and the differences between them:
1. Response with "finish_reason": "stop"

python

ModelResponse(id='chatcmpl-26de4927-d42f-4fe2-a010-bd6e3df29aaa', choices=[Choices(finish_reason='stop', index=0, message=Message(content=None, role='assistant', tool_calls=[ChatCompletionMessageToolCall(index=0, function=Function(arguments='{"string": "What is the capital of France?"}', name='function3'), id='call_c16fb6c9-5081-4576-a92c-a4e4194a2942', type='function')], function_call=None))], created=1730569921, ...)

    Explanation: The "finish_reason": "stop" indicates that the model completed its response as intended without hitting the token limit or needing to cut off mid-response.
    Interpretation: Here, the model determined that the query ("What is the capital of France?") could be answered by function3, which handles questions that can be answered directly (likely with a simple, self-contained answer).
    Outcome: This response is well-formed, indicating that the assistant handled the query as expected and completed the response without needing to add more or being cut off.

2. Response with "finish_reason": "length"

python

ModelResponse(id='chatcmpl-ba911c8e-cf5f-4c95-a94a-84d90b8f851e', choices=[Choices(finish_reason='length', index=0, message=Message(content='2\n```tool_code\nprint(default', role='assistant', tool_calls=None, function_call=None))], created=1730570270, ...)

    Explanation: The "finish_reason": "length" indicates that the response was cut off because it reached the maximum token limit set in the model's configuration. This is generally an unintended outcome for simple questions, as it often implies that the response was incomplete.
    Interpretation: The response here was attempting to proceed with an answer (likely directing to function2), but was abruptly cut off. This could be due to either:
        Insufficient max_tokens Setting: The token limit was set too low to allow the model to finish the intended output.
        Unexpected Expansion of Response: The model may have started generating additional context or information that made it exceed the limit, even for a short, factual question.
    Outcome: The response was incomplete, leading to a potential failure in handling the query.

Key Differences

    Completion: "stop" indicates a completed response, while "length" shows that the model’s response was cut off.
    Quality of Answer: "stop" typically yields a coherent answer or directive, whereas "length" suggests that the response may need adjustment or a higher token limit for complete handling.
    Suggested Action: For "length" issues, try increasing max_tokens slightly and ensure concise prompts, especially for simple questions like "What is the capital of France?".

In practice, "finish_reason": "length" responses often benefit from refining the query or adjusting token limits to prevent incomplete outputs.
You said:
It seems the error time, lesser tokens were used up? I just don't get it
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

You're absolutely correct in observing that the "finish_reason": "length" error occurred despite fewer tokens being used. This can indeed be confusing. Let’s break down the possible causes for this behavior:
Possible Reasons for "finish_reason": "length" with Lower Token Usage

    Premature Stopping Due to Incomplete Code or Response Structure:
        Sometimes, a model may initiate a response involving code, formatting (e.g., print(default), or special tokens (like \n). If it begins generating code or some kind of structured response, it may encounter issues partway, even if the overall token count is low. This can lead to premature stops as it might fail to complete the intended structure within the provided limit.

    Internal Constraints and Safety Checks:
        Some language models have internal constraints or checks that can cause them to halt prematurely if the generation seems to stray into unproductive or repetitive content. Even though the model was producing a low token count response, it might still have triggered an early cutoff due to safety or coherency checks.

    Model's Interpretative Overhead:
        Language models occasionally try to generate longer or more complex responses than expected, especially if they infer that additional context or clarification is needed. In this case, the model may have over-interpreted "What is the capital of France?" and started generating more extensive output than anticipated (for example, by trying to call function2).

    Output Formatting Error:
        If the model begins generating a complex output (like code or function calls), and something interrupts it before completion, this can trigger an early "finish_reason": "length". In this case, "print(default" might indicate the start of such formatting or structure, leading to an early stop if it wasn't completed correctly.

What You Can Try

    Increase max_tokens slightly to allow the model more room in case it’s trying to generate something structured.
    Simplify or Clarify Instructions to reduce interpretive complexity for simple questions.
    Specify the Expected Output Format explicitly to minimize model overinterpretation and keep responses short, especially for factual questions like "What is the capital of France?".

In summary, even though fewer tokens were used, structural or interpretative overhead can still cause the model to prematurely stop. Adjusting max_tokens or clarifying the response expectations often helps resolve this behavior.

can u write a set of queries to test this?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

Certainly! Here’s a set of diverse queries to test each path (1, 2, or 3) based on the instructions given to the agent. These queries are designed to evaluate whether the agent can correctly choose between requiring uploaded documents, needing external sources, or answering directly.
Test Queries
Path 1: Requires Only Uploaded Documents

These questions should imply that the answer lies within uploaded documents, like specific reports or notes the user provided.

    “What were the key findings in the quarterly report I uploaded?”
    “Can you summarize the main points from my uploaded lecture notes on biology?”
    “List the main conclusions from the project proposal document I shared.”
    “What are the financial statistics mentioned in the document I uploaded?”
    “Provide an overview of the research methodologies detailed in my document.”

Path 2: Requires External Sources (Generic or Fact-Based Questions)

These are broader questions, where the assistant would likely need external information or context that wouldn’t typically be found in a user-uploaded document.

    “What is the capital of France?”
    “Explain the causes of climate change.”
    “Who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2023?”
    “Describe the impact of social media on mental health.”
    “What are the latest advancements in artificial intelligence?”

Path 3: Can Be Answered Directly

These questions have straightforward answers or involve simple calculations or general knowledge that doesn’t require further context from documents or external sources.

    “What is 10 + 15?”
    “Convert 100 miles to kilometers.”
    “How many days are there in a leap year?”
    “What is the square root of 64?”
    “Name the three primary colors.”

These queries should help verify if the model is correctly assigning each question to path 1, 2, or 3 based on the criteria you provided. Running these will allow you to check the response paths and confirm if the system behavior aligns with the expected outcomes.

I have a json stringified as a string in python, how do  i get it back
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

To convert a JSON string (that is currently a Python string) back into a JSON object (like a dictionary or list in Python), you can use the json.loads() method from Python's json module. Here’s how to do it:

python

import json

# Example JSON string (notice it's a string in Python)
json_string = '{"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}'

# Convert JSON string back to Python dictionary
data = json.loads(json_string)

# Now `data` is a dictionary
print(data)
print(data["name"])  # Accessing values in the dictionary

Explanation

    json.loads(json_string): This method takes the JSON string and parses it into a Python dictionary or list, depending on the structure of the JSON data.

After running this, data will be a standard Python dictionary (or list if the JSON represents an array), allowing you to access keys and values normally.

write a method initiate_chat for ths on the lines of autogen
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

Here’s how you can implement an initiate_chat method for your Agent class. This method will start an interactive chat loop with the user, allowing them to enter queries and receive responses from the agent. We’ll also add some enhancements for handling input, output, and error handling.

Here’s the code:

python

class Agent:
    model: str 
    instructions: str = "You are a helpful agent"
    llm: LLMAgent = pydantic.Field(default=None, exclude=True)
    tools: List[Dict] = []
    
    def __init__(self, model, llm, instructions=None):
        self.model = model
        self.llm = llm
        self.instructions = instructions
        
    @classmethod
    def from_model(cls, model: str, instructions: str, **kwargs):
        llm = LLMAgent(model=model, **kwargs)
        return cls(model=model, llm=llm, instructions=instructions)
    
    def add_tools(self, tools: List[Callable]):
        for tool in tools:
            self.tools.append(function_to_dict(tool))
            
    def send_request(self, query):
        try:
            messages = [
                {"role": "system", "content": self.instructions},
                {"role": "user", "content": query}
            ]
            response = self.llm.get_response(messages, tools=self.tools)
            res = response.choices[0]["message"]["tool_calls"]
            return res
        except Exception as e:
            event = {
                "_type": "lite_llm_agent_error",
                "error": str(e)
            }
            raise e
    
    def initiate_chat(self):
        print("Chat session initiated. Type 'exit' to end the chat.\n")
        
        while True:
            user_input = input("User: ")
            if user_input.lower() == "exit":
                print("Chat session ended.")
                break
            
            try:
                # Send the user input as a request to the model
                response = self.send_request(user_input)
                
                # Display the model's response
                print("Agent:", response)
            
            except Exception as e:
                # Handle any errors gracefully and inform the user
                print("An error occurred:", str(e))

Explanation of initiate_chat Method

    Looping for User Input: The method continuously prompts the user for input until they type "exit" to end the chat.
    Calling send_request: Each user input is sent to send_request, which processes the message and retrieves the model’s response.
    Displaying Response: After receiving the response, it is printed to the console as the agent’s reply.
    Error Handling: Any exceptions during the response retrieval are caught, and an error message is shown to the user without terminating the chat session.

Usage Example

python

agent = Agent.from_model("gemini/gemini-1.5-flash", instructions="You are a helpful assistant")
agent.add_tools([your_tool_1, your_tool_2])  # Add any tools you have defined
agent.initiate_chat()

This setup will start an interactive chat, where the agent responds based on the defined model and tools.

        """Initiate a chat with the recipient agent.

        Reset the consecutive auto reply counter.
        If clear_history is True, the chat history with the recipient agent will be cleared.


        Args:
            recipient: the recipient agent.
            clear_history (bool): whether to clear the chat history with the agent. Default is True.
            silent (bool or None): (Experimental) whether to print the messages for this conversation. Default is False.
            cache (AbstractCache or None): the cache client to be used for this conversation. Default is None.
            max_turns (int or None): the maximum number of turns for the chat between the two agents. One turn means one conversation round trip. Note that this is different from
                [max_consecutive_auto_reply](#max_consecutive_auto_reply) which is the maximum number of consecutive auto replies; and it is also different from [max_rounds in GroupChat](./groupchat#groupchat-objects) which is the maximum number of rounds in a group chat session.
                If max_turns is set to None, the chat will continue until a termination condition is met. Default is None.
            summary_method (str or callable): a method to get a summary from the chat. Default is DEFAULT_SUMMARY_METHOD, i.e., "last_msg".

            Supported strings are "last_msg" and "reflection_with_llm":
                - when set to "last_msg", it returns the last message of the dialog as the summary.
                - when set to "reflection_with_llm", it returns a summary extracted using an llm client.
                    llm_config must be set in either the recipient or sender.

            A callable summary_method should take the recipient and sender agent in a chat as input and return a string of summary. E.g.,

            

python
            def my_summary_method(
                sender: ConversableAgent,
                recipient: ConversableAgent,
                summary_args: dict,
            ):
                return recipient.last_message(sender)["content"]


            summary_args (dict): a dictionary of arguments to be passed to the summary_method.
                One example key is "summary_prompt", and value is a string of text used to prompt a LLM-based agent (the sender or receiver agent) to reflect
                on the conversation and extract a summary when summary_method is "reflection_with_llm".
                The default summary_prompt is DEFAULT_SUMMARY_PROMPT, i.e., "Summarize takeaway from the conversation. Do not add any introductory phrases. If the intended request is NOT properly addressed, please point it out."
                Another available key is "summary_role", which is the role of the message sent to the agent in charge of summarizing. Default is "system".
            message (str, dict or Callable): the initial message to be sent to the recipient. Needs to be provided. Otherwise, input() will be called to get the initial message.
                - If a string or a dict is provided, it will be used as the initial message.        generate_init_message is called to generate the initial message for the agent based on this string and the context.
                    If dict, it may contain the following reserved fields (either content or tool_calls need to be provided).

                        1. "content": content of the message, can be None.
                        2. "function_call": a dictionary containing the function name and arguments. (deprecated in favor of "tool_calls")
                        3. "tool_calls": a list of dictionaries containing the function name and arguments.
                        4. "role": role of the message, can be "assistant", "user", "function".
                            This field is only needed to distinguish between "function" or "assistant"/"user".
                        5. "name": In most cases, this field is not needed. When the role is "function", this field is needed to indicate the function name.
                        6. "context" (dict): the context of the message, which will be passed to
                            [OpenAIWrapper.create](../oai/client#create).

                - If a callable is provided, it will be called to get the initial message in the form of a string or a dict.
                    If the returned type is dict, it may contain the reserved fields mentioned above.

                    Example of a callable message (returning a string):

Certainly! To create a more robust and user-friendly initiate_chat method for your Agent class, inspired by the provided autogen example, we need to incorporate several advanced features such as handling chat history, managing conversation turns, summarizing conversations, and providing flexible message inputs.

Below is an enhanced version of your Agent class with the initiate_chat method implemented along the lines of the autogen example. This implementation assumes that certain auxiliary classes and methods (like ConversableAgent, AbstractCache, and ChatResult) are defined elsewhere in your codebase. If they are not, you'll need to implement or adjust them accordingly.

Explanation of Enhancements

    Comprehensive Parameter Handling:
        recipient: Represents the agent you are chatting with. This allows for more complex interactions if you have multiple agents.
        clear_history: Clears the chat history to start fresh.
        silent: When set to True, suppresses all print statements for a quieter operation, useful for automated environments.
        cache: Allows you to pass a caching mechanism to store conversation data, improving efficiency for repeated queries.
        max_turns: Limits the number of conversation turns to prevent infinite loops.
        summary_method & summary_args: Provides options to summarize the conversation using different methods, including custom functions.
        message: Accepts an initial message in various formats (string, dict, or callable), offering flexibility in how the chat starts.

    Enhanced Error Handling:
        The method catches exceptions during the chat loop and provides user-friendly error messages without crashing the program.

    Flexible Message Input:
        Supports different types of initial messages, allowing for greater flexibility in initiating chats programmatically or interactively.

    Chat History Management:
        Maintains a chat_history list to keep track of the conversation, which is useful for summarization and logging.

    Summary Generation:
        Integrates a mechanism to summarize the conversation using either predefined methods (last_msg, reflection_with_llm) or custom callable functions.

    Turn Management:
        Implements a turn_count to track the number of exchanges and enforce the max_turns limit.

    Silent Mode:
        When silent is enabled, the method suppresses print statements, making it suitable for backend operations or testing environments.

    Extensibility:
        The method is designed to be easily extendable with additional features like more sophisticated caching, advanced summary methods, or integration with other systems.

Usage Example

Here's how you can utilize the enhanced Agent class and its initiate_chat method:

python

# Define any tools or functions you need
def function1(uploaded_doc_names: List[str]):
    return "Response from function1 based on uploaded documents."

def function2(uploaded_doc_names: List[str]):
    return "Response from function2 using external sources."

def function3(query: str):
    return "Response from function3 with direct answer."

# Initialize the Agent
agent = Agent.from_model(
    model="gemini/gemini-1.5-flash",
    instructions="""You are a helpful assistant. Return 1, 2, or 3 based on the following:
    1 - Use it when answer can be provided solely based on uploaded documents. It must be implied that query requires answer from uploaded documents.
    2 - Use it when question is too generic, and you need to use external sources
    3 - Answer can be provided directly
    """,
    api_key='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'  # Replace with your actual API key
)

# Add tools to the Agent
agent.add_tools([function1, function2, function3])

# Initialize the LLM model (assuming CustomLiteLLMChat is correctly implemented)
model = CustomLiteLLMChat(
    model="gemini/gemini-1.5-flash",
    api_key='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE',  # Replace with your actual API key
    temperature=0.0,
    max_tokens=1000,
)

# Example of a simple summary method
def simple_summary(recipient: ConversableAgent, sender: Agent, summary_args: dict) -> str:
    return "This is a summary of the conversation."

# Start the chat session
recipient_agent = ConversableAgent()  # Replace with actual agent initialization
chat_result = agent.initiate_chat(
    recipient=recipient_agent,
    clear_history=True,
    silent=False,
    cache=None,
    max_turns=10,
    summary_method=simple_summary,
    summary_args={"summary_prompt": "Provide a brief summary."},
    message="Hello, how can you assist me today?"
)

# Handle the ChatResult as needed

Important Considerations

    Dependencies:
        ConversableAgent, AbstractCache, and ChatResult: Ensure these classes are properly defined in your codebase as they are crucial for the initiate_chat method.
        LLMAgent: Replace the placeholder with your actual LLM agent implementation.

    Function to Dictionary Conversion:
        The function_to_dict method converts Python functions to a dictionary format expected by the Agent. Ensure this aligns with how your LLMAgent expects tools to be formatted.

    Error Logging:
        The commented logger.error line can be activated if you have a logger set up. This helps in debugging and monitoring errors without exposing them to the end-user.

    Summary Methods:
        The summary_method can be extended to include more sophisticated summarization techniques, especially leveraging LLMs for more meaningful summaries.

    Security:
        Always handle API keys securely. Avoid hardcoding them and consider using environment variables or secure vaults.

    Extensibility:
        The initiate_chat method is designed to be flexible. You can further extend it by integrating features like context-aware responses, user authentication, or multi-turn dialogue management.

Conclusion

The enhanced initiate_chat method provides a robust and flexible framework for interacting with your Agent. It incorporates advanced features inspired by autogen, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly chat experience. Make sure to integrate and test this method within your existing codebase, adapting auxiliary classes and methods as necessary to fit your specific requirements.

Explanation of the Enhanced initiate_chat Method

    Parameters:
        max_turns (Optional[int]): Limits the number of conversation turns to prevent infinite loops. Defaults to None (unlimited).
        summary_method (Optional[Callable[[List[Dict]], str]]): A function to summarize the chat history. Defaults to None (no summary).
        summary_args (Optional[dict]): Arguments to pass to the summary_method. Defaults to an empty dictionary.
        initial_message (Optional[str]): An initial message to start the chat. If None, the user is prompted to input.

    Chat Loop:
        The method enters a loop where it continuously prompts the user for input.
        For each user input, it determines the appropriate response path (1, 2, or 3) by calling send_request.
        Based on the path:
            Path 1: Responds using only uploaded documents.
            Path 2: Responds using both uploaded documents and external sources.
            Path 3: Provides a direct answer using the LLM.
        After each response, if a summary_method is provided, it summarizes the recent conversation.

    Error Handling:
        The method gracefully handles errors during path determination and response generation, informing the user without crashing the chat session.

    Termination:
        The chat session can be terminated by typing 'exit' or 'quit'.
        If max_turns is reached, the session ends automatically.

    ChatResult:
        After the session ends, a ChatResult object containing the conversation history is returned for further processing or logging.

Customization Points

    LLMAgent Implementation:
        Replace the placeholder LLMAgent class with your actual implementation that interfaces with your language model provider.
        Ensure that the get_response method correctly parses and returns the response structure expected by the Agent class.

    CustomLiteLLMChat:
        Similarly, replace the CustomLiteLLMChat placeholder with your actual implementation.

    Tool Functions:
        The example includes simple tool functions (function1, function2, function3). Customize these functions to perform actual tasks based on your application's requirements.

    Summary Methods:
        The simple_summary function provided is a basic example. You can create more sophisticated summary methods as needed, potentially leveraging LLMs for better summarization.

Usage Instructions

    Initialize the Agent:

    python

agent = Agent.from_model(
    model="gemini/gemini-1.5-flash",
    instructions="""You are a helpful assistant. Return 1, 2, or 3 based on the following:
1 - Use it when answer can be provided solely based on uploaded documents. It must be implied that query requires answer from uploaded documents.
2 - Use it when question is too generic, and you need to use external sources.
3 - Answer can be provided directly.""",
    api_key='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'  # Replace with your actual API key
)

Add Tools:

python

agent.add_tools([function1, function2, function3])

Start the Chat Session:

python

chat_result = agent.initiate_chat(
    max_turns=10,
    summary_method=simple_summary,
    summary_args={"delimiter": " | "},
    initial_message=None  # Start with user input
)

View Chat History (Optional):

python

    print("\nFinal Chat History:")
    for msg in chat_result.history:
        print(f"{msg['role'].capitalize()}: {msg['content']}")

Example Interaction

vbnet

Chat session initiated. Type 'exit' to end the chat.

User: What is the capital of France?
Agent: This is the response that can be answered directly without retrieval.
Response: The capital of France is Paris.
Summary: This is the response that can be answered directly without retrieval. | The capital of France is Paris.
User: exit
Chat session ended.

Final Chat History:
User: What is the capital of France?
Assistant: This is the response that can be answered directly without retrieval.
Assistant: The capital of France is Paris.
User: exit

Final Notes

    Security: Ensure that your API keys are stored securely. Avoid hardcoding them directly into your scripts. Consider using environment variables or secure storage solutions.

    Extensibility: This setup is designed to be easily extendable. You can add more sophisticated tools, enhance the send_request logic, or integrate more advanced summarization techniques as your application evolves.

    Testing: Thoroughly test each component (e.g., send_request, tool functions, summary methods) to ensure they work seamlessly together. This will help in identifying and resolving issues early in the development process.

If you have any further questions or need additional customization, feel free to ask!

ChatGPT

Understood. Let's refocus and create a robust initiate_chat method for your Agent class without relying on the path-based (1, 2, 3) testing mechanism. Instead, we'll design it to handle user interactions seamlessly by leveraging the tools you've added to the agent. This method will:

    Handle User Input: Continuously prompt the user for input until they decide to exit.
    Process Responses: Send user queries to the LLM, handle any tool calls, execute the corresponding tools, and integrate their responses.
    Manage Conversation Flow: Maintain a history of the conversation for context and potential future enhancements like summarization or context-aware responses.
    Error Handling: Gracefully handle any errors during the interaction without crashing the chat session.

Detailed Explanation
1. Agent Class Enhancements

    Initialization (__init__ and from_model):
        The from_model class method initializes the LLMAgent with the provided model, API key, temperature, and max tokens. This ensures that the agent is ready to interact with the LLM.

    Adding Tools (add_tools):
        The add_tools method allows you to add callable functions (tools) to the agent. Each tool is converted to a dictionary with its name and function reference using the function_to_dict helper function.

    Executing Tools (execute_tool):
        The execute_tool method takes a tool_call dictionary, identifies the corresponding tool by name, parses the arguments, and executes the tool function. This method ensures that tool executions are handled systematically.

    Sending Requests (send_request):
        The send_request method sends user queries to the LLM and processes the responses. It checks if the response contains tool calls and executes them accordingly. If no tools are called, it returns a direct response from the LLM.

2. initiate_chat Method

The initiate_chat method manages the interactive chat session. Here's how it works:

    Starting the Chat:
        Prints an initiation message and handles an optional initial message.
    Chat Loop:
        Continues to prompt the user for input until they type 'exit' or 'quit', or until the max_turns limit is reached.
    Processing User Input:
        Sends each user query to the LLM via the send_request method.
    Handling Responses:
        If the LLM response includes tool calls, it executes each tool and provides the tool's response to the user.
        If the LLM provides a direct response, it relays that response to the user.
    Summarization (Optional):
        After each interaction, if a summary_method is provided, it summarizes the recent conversation history and displays it.
    Error Handling:
        Gracefully handles any exceptions during tool execution or summarization without terminating the chat session abruptly.

3. Tool Functions

Three example tools are provided:

    summarize:
        Simulates summarizing uploaded documents. In a real-world scenario, this would involve reading and summarizing the content of the provided documents.

    calculate:
        Performs basic mathematical calculations using Python's eval function. Caution: Using eval can be dangerous if not properly sanitized. Consider using safer alternatives like ast.literal_eval or specialized math parsing libraries for production use.

    direct_response:
        Provides a direct answer to user queries without additional processing.

4. Summary Method

A simple simple_summary method is provided that concatenates the last two messages in the chat history. You can customize this method to implement more sophisticated summarization logic, potentially leveraging the LLM for better summaries.
5. Usage Example

The if __name__ == "__main__": block demonstrates how to initialize the agent, add tools, and start the chat session. Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' with your actual API key.
Example Interaction

vbnet

Chat session initiated. Type 'exit' to end the chat.

User: Hello
Agent: This is a direct response from the agent.
Summary: This is a direct response from the agent.
User: What is the capital of France?
Agent: This is a direct response from the agent.
Summary: This is a direct response from the agent. | This is a direct response from the agent.
User: Summarize
Agent: Summarized content from documents: doc1.pdf.
Summary: Summarized content from documents: doc1.pdf. | Summarized content from documents: doc1.pdf.
User: Calculate 10 + 15
Agent: The result of 10 + 15 is 25.
Summary: The result of 10 + 15 is 25. | The result of 10 + 15 is 25.
User: exit
Chat session ended.

Final Chat History:
User: Hello
Assistant: This is a direct response from the agent.
User: What is the capital of France?
Assistant: This is a direct response from the agent.
User: Summarize
Assistant: Summarized content from documents: doc1.pdf.
User: Calculate 10 + 15
Assistant: The result of 10 + 15 is 25.
User: exit

Important Considerations

    Tool Integration:
        Ensure that your tools are well-defined and handle their specific tasks effectively. In the example above, tools are simplistic placeholders. Replace them with actual implementations tailored to your application's needs.

    Security:
        Be cautious with functions like calculate that use eval. Always sanitize and validate inputs to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.

    LLM Integration:
        The LLMAgent and CustomLiteLLMChat classes are placeholders. Replace them with your actual implementations that interface with your chosen LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini).
        Ensure that the get_response methods in these classes correctly interact with the LLM APIs and handle responses appropriately.

    Error Handling:
        The send_request method includes basic error handling. You can enhance this by implementing more granular exception management and logging mechanisms as needed.

    Extensibility:
        The initiate_chat method is designed to be flexible. You can extend it by adding features like user authentication, context preservation across sessions, advanced summarization methods, and more.

    ChatResult Implementation:
        The ChatResult class is a placeholder. Implement it to store and manage chat history, metadata, or any other relevant information as required by your application.

    Environment Variables for API Keys:
        For security, avoid hardcoding API keys directly in your scripts. Use environment variables or secure configuration management systems to manage sensitive information.

    Testing:
        Thoroughly test each component (tools, LLM responses, initiate_chat method) to ensure they work as expected. This helps in identifying and resolving issues early in the development process.

Final Notes

By removing the path-based testing mechanism and focusing on tool-based interactions, the initiate_chat method now provides a more realistic and functional chat experience. Users can interact with the agent, trigger specific tools based on their queries, and receive appropriate responses seamlessly.

Feel free to further customize and enhance this setup to better fit your specific requirements. If you encounter any issues or need additional features, don't hesitate to ask!

here is the complete code u need to work on
ChatGPT

Certainly! Let's enhance your Agent class by implementing a robust initiate_chat method tailored to your current setup. This method will facilitate an interactive chat session, handle user inputs, process tool calls, execute corresponding tools, and manage the conversation flow effectively.
Overview of Enhancements

    Flexible Response Handling: The initiate_chat method will handle both tool-based responses and direct responses from the LLM.
    Tool Execution: When the LLM response includes tool calls, the agent will execute the corresponding tools and provide their outputs.
    Chat History Management: Maintains a history of the conversation for potential future enhancements like summarization.
    Graceful Termination: Allows users to exit the chat gracefully by typing commands like 'exit' or 'quit'.
    Error Handling: Handles exceptions gracefully without crashing the chat session.
    Optional Summarization: Supports summarizing the conversation if a summary_method is provided.

Complete Enhanced Agent Class

Below is the complete Agent class with the newly implemented initiate_chat method. This version integrates seamlessly with your existing LLMAgent and handles tool executions appropriately.

Detailed Explanation
1. Agent Class Enhancements

    execute_tool Method:
        This method takes a tool_call dictionary, extracts the tool name and arguments, finds the corresponding tool from the tools list, and executes it with the provided arguments.
        It handles errors during tool execution and returns appropriate error messages if a tool is not found or fails to execute.

    send_request Method:
        Sends user queries to the LLM by constructing the appropriate message format.
        Parses the LLM's response to determine if tool calls are present.
        Executes the tools if tool_calls are detected and returns their responses.
        If no tools are called, it returns the direct response from the LLM.
        Handles cases where the LLM response might not be in JSON format by treating it as a direct response.

    initiate_chat Method:
        Manages the interactive chat session with the user.
        Continuously prompts the user for input until the user types 'exit' or 'quit', or until the max_turns limit is reached.
        Processes each user input by sending it to the LLM and handling the response appropriately.
        Maintains a chat_history list to keep track of the conversation.
        Optionally summarizes the conversation after each turn if a summary_method is provided.
        Gracefully handles errors and ensures the chat session does not crash unexpectedly.

2. Tool Functions

    summarize:
        Simulates summarizing uploaded documents. In a real-world scenario, replace the mock implementation with actual summarization logic.

    calculate:
        Performs basic mathematical calculations using Python's eval. Caution: Using eval can be dangerous as it can execute arbitrary code. For production use, consider using a safe math parser or restrict the evaluation context.

    direct_response:
        Provides direct answers to user queries without additional processing.

3. Summary Method

    simple_summary:
        A basic summary method that concatenates the last two messages in the chat history.
        You can implement more sophisticated summarization logic or integrate with another LLM for better summaries.

4. Usage Example

    Initialization:
        The Agent is initialized using the from_model class method, specifying the model, instructions, API key, temperature, and maximum tokens.
    Adding Tools:
        The summarize, calculate, and direct_response functions are added as tools to the agent.
    Starting the Chat Session:
        The initiate_chat method is called with a max_turns limit, a simple_summary method for summarization, and no initial message (prompts the user for input).
    Final Chat History:
        After the chat session ends, the final chat history is printed, showing all interactions between the user and the agent.

Example Interaction

vbnet

Chat session initiated. Type 'exit' or 'quit' to end the chat.

User: Hello
Agent: Direct answer to your query: Hello
Summary: Direct answer to your query: Hello
User: What is the capital of France?
Agent: Direct answer to your query: What is the capital of France?
Summary: Direct answer to your query: What is the capital of France? | Direct answer to your query: What is the capital of France?
User: Summarize
Agent: Summarized content from documents: doc1.pdf.
Summary: Summarized content from documents: doc1.pdf. | Summarized content from documents: doc1.pdf.
User: Calculate 10 + 15
Agent: The result of 10 + 15 is 25.
Summary: The result of 10 + 15 is 25. | The result of 10 + 15 is 25.
User: exit
Chat session ended.

Final Chat History:
User: Hello
Assistant: Direct answer to your query: Hello
User: What is the capital of France?
Assistant: Direct answer to your query: What is the capital of France?
User: Summarize
Assistant: Summarized content from documents: doc1.pdf.
User: Calculate 10 + 15
Assistant: The result of 10 + 15 is 25.
User: exit

Important Considerations

    Security with calculate Function:
        The calculate function uses eval to evaluate mathematical expressions. This can be a security risk as it can execute arbitrary code. To mitigate this:
            Use a Safe Evaluator: Consider using the ast.literal_eval for safer evaluations or a dedicated math parsing library like sympy.
            Restrict the Evaluation Context: Limit the available functions and variables in the eval context to prevent malicious code execution.

    python

import math

def calculate(expression: str) -> str:
    """Function to perform calculations based on the given expression."""
    try:
        # Define a safe evaluation context
        allowed_names = {k: v for k, v in math.__dict__.items() if not k.startswith("__")}
        result = eval(expression, {"__builtins__": {}}, allowed_names)
        return f"The result of {expression} is {result}."
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error in calculation: {str(e)}."

Handling Non-JSON Responses:

    The send_request method attempts to parse the LLM response as JSON. If the response isn't in JSON format, it treats it as a direct response. Ensure that your LLM returns well-structured JSON responses when tool calls are intended.

LLMAgent Integration:

    Ensure that the LLMAgent class correctly interfaces with your chosen LLM provider. Replace the placeholder implementation with actual API calls and handle responses as per your provider's specifications.

Tool Call Structure:

    Ensure that when invoking tool calls, the LLM response adheres to the expected structure. Each tool_call should include the tool name and the required arguments in JSON format.

Environment Variables for API Keys:

    For security, avoid hardcoding API keys directly in your scripts. Use environment variables or secure configuration management systems to manage sensitive information.

python

    import os

    api_key = os.getenv('LLM_API_KEY')
    if not api_key:
        raise ValueError("API key not found. Please set the 'LLM_API_KEY' environment variable.")

    Extensibility:
        The initiate_chat method is designed to be flexible. You can further extend it by adding features like:
            User Authentication: Authenticate users before allowing them to interact with the agent.
            Context Preservation: Maintain context across multiple chat sessions.
            Advanced Summarization: Integrate more sophisticated summarization methods using the LLM.

    Testing:
        Thoroughly test each component (tools, LLM responses, initiate_chat method) to ensure they work as expected.
        Use mock responses from the LLM to simulate different scenarios like tool calls, direct responses, and error conditions.

Final Notes

This enhanced Agent class provides a robust framework for interactive chat sessions, handling both tool-based and direct responses seamlessly. Ensure that all dependencies (like litellm, pathway, and any other required libraries) are correctly installed and configured in your environment.

Feel free to further customize and extend this setup to better fit your specific requirements. If you encounter any issues or need additional features, don't hesitate to ask!

Explanation of the Enhanced Agent Class
1. LLMAgent Class

    Initialization (__init__ and from_model):
        Initializes the LLMAgent with the specified model, API key, temperature, and maximum tokens.
        Integrates with litellm to handle LLM interactions.

    __wrapped__ Method:
        Sends messages to the LiteLLM service and retrieves the response.
        Handles exceptions and returns None if an error occurs.

    get_response Method:
        A helper method to directly call the __wrapped__ method.

2. Agent Class

    Initialization (__init__ and from_model):
        Sets up the agent with the specified model, instructions, and LLM agent.
        Uses the from_model class method to initialize the LLMAgent with necessary parameters.

    Adding Tools (add_tools):
        Adds callable functions (tools) to the agent by converting them into a dictionary format using function_to_dict.

    Executing Tools (execute_tool):
        Identifies the appropriate tool based on the tool_call dictionary.
        Executes the tool with the provided arguments and handles any exceptions that occur during execution.

    Sending Requests (send_request):
        Constructs the message payload with system instructions and user query.
        Sends the request to the LLM via the LLMAgent.
        Parses the LLM's response to determine if tool calls are present.
        Executes the tools if tool calls are detected and returns their responses.
        If no tools are called, it returns the direct response from the LLM.
        Handles cases where the LLM response might not be in JSON format by treating it as a direct response.

    Initiating Chat (initiate_chat):
        Manages the interactive chat session with the user.
        Continuously prompts the user for input until they type 'exit' or 'quit', or until the max_turns limit is reached.
        Processes each user input by sending it to the LLM and handling the response appropriately.
        Maintains a chat_history list to keep track of the conversation.
        Ensures that the chat session handles both tool-based and direct responses seamlessly.
        Provides comprehensive error handling to maintain chat session stability.

3. Tool Functions

    summarize:
        Simulates summarizing uploaded documents. Replace the mock implementation with actual summarization logic as needed.

    calculate:
        Performs basic mathematical calculations using Python's eval.
        Security Warning: Using eval can execute arbitrary code. For production, use safer alternatives like ast.literal_eval or specialized math parsing libraries.

    direct_response:
        Provides direct answers to user queries without additional processing.

4. ChatResult Class

    ChatResult:
        A simple placeholder class to store the conversation history.
        You can expand this class to include more metadata or functionalities as required.

5. Usage Example

    Initialization:
        The Agent is initialized with the specified model, instructions, API key, temperature, and maximum tokens.

    Adding Tools:
        The summarize, calculate, and direct_response functions are added as tools to the agent.

    Starting the Chat Session:
        The initiate_chat method is called with a max_turns limit of 10 and no initial message, prompting the user to start the conversation.

    Final Chat History:
        After the chat session ends, the final conversation history is printed, showing all interactions between the user and the agent.

Example Interaction

vbnet

Chat session initiated. Type 'exit' or 'quit' to end the chat.

User: Hello
Agent: Direct answer to your query: Hello
User: What is the capital of France?
Agent: Direct answer to your query: What is the capital of France?
User: Summarize
Agent: Summarized content from documents: doc1.pdf.
User: Calculate 10 + 15
Agent: The result of 10 + 15 is 25.
User: exit
Chat session ended.

Final Chat History:
User: Hello
Assistant: Direct answer to your query: Hello
User: What is the capital of France?
Assistant: Direct answer to your query: What is the capital of France?
User: Summarize
Assistant: Summarized content from documents: doc1.pdf.
User: Calculate 10 + 15
Assistant: The result of 10 + 15 is 25.
User: exit

Important Considerations

    Security with calculate Function:
        The calculate function uses eval to evaluate mathematical expressions, which can be dangerous if not properly sanitized.
        Recommendation: Replace eval with a safer alternative, such as ast.literal_eval or a dedicated math parsing library like sympy.

    python

import ast

def calculate(expression: str) -> str:
    """Function to perform calculations based on the given expression."""
    try:
        # Use ast.literal_eval for safer evaluation
        result = ast.literal_eval(expression)
        return f"The result of {expression} is {result}."
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error in calculation: {str(e)}."

Handling Non-JSON Responses:

    Ensure that the LLM (litellm.completion) returns well-structured JSON responses when tool calls are intended.
    If the response is not in JSON format, the system treats it as a direct response.

LLMAgent Integration:

    Make sure the LLMAgent class correctly interfaces with your chosen LLM provider (litellm in this case).
    Replace placeholder implementations with actual API calls and handle responses according to your provider's specifications.

Tool Call Structure:

    Ensure that when invoking tool calls, the LLM response adheres to the expected structure.
    Each tool_call should include the tool name and the required arguments in JSON format.

Environment Variables for API Keys:

    For security, avoid hardcoding API keys directly in your scripts. Use environment variables or secure configuration management systems to manage sensitive information.

python

    import os

    api_key = os.getenv('LLM_API_KEY')
    if not api_key:
        raise ValueError("API key not found. Please set the 'LLM_API_KEY' environment variable.")

    Extensibility:
        The initiate_chat method is designed to be flexible. You can further extend it by adding features like user authentication, context preservation across sessions, or integration with other systems.

    Testing:
        Thoroughly test each component (tools, LLM responses, initiate_chat method) to ensure they work as expected.
        Use mock responses from the LLM to simulate different scenarios like tool calls, direct responses, and error conditions.

Final Notes

This refined Agent class provides a robust framework for interactive chat sessions without any summarization functionalities. It handles user inputs, processes tool calls, executes corresponding tools, and provides direct responses seamlessly. Ensure that all dependencies (litellm, pathway, and any other required libraries) are correctly installed and configured in your environment.

Feel free to further customize and enhance this setup to better fit your specific requirements. If you encounter any issues or need additional features, don't hesitate to ask!

ChatGPT

Understood. Let's enhance your Agent class by implementing an initiate_chat method that allows interaction between two agents. This method will enable a conversation where one agent responds to the user and the other agent responds to the first agent's responses. This setup can be particularly useful for scenarios where you want to simulate a dialogue between two AI agents or have collaborative interactions.
Overview of Enhancements

    Two-Agent Interaction: The initiate_chat method will accept a second Agent instance (partner_agent) to facilitate conversations between the two agents.
    User Input Handling: The user can initiate the conversation, and both agents will take turns responding.
    Chat History Management: Maintain a history of the conversation for reference.
    Graceful Termination: Allow users to end the chat by typing commands like 'exit' or 'quit'.
    Robust Error Handling: Ensure that any errors during the conversation do not crash the chat session.

Complete Enhanced Agent Class

Below is the complete Agent class with the newly implemented initiate_chat method that supports interaction between two agents. This version removes any summary-related functionalities as per your request.
