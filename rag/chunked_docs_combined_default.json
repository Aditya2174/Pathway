            "**Supply of Components**<br><br>Although most components essential to the Company\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain \ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with \nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many \ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide \nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.<br><br>The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by \nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new \ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have \nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to \nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements.<br><br>The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the \nCompany will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.<br><br>**Research and Development**<br><br>Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company\u2019s \nability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, \nservices and technologies to the marketplace.

            "The Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. \nThese attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal \nbusiness operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers for its products \nand services, impact the Company\u2019s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to \nlitigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks \nare expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques \nthat are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the \nCompany\u2019s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers \ncan escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict.<br><br>Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many \ncompanies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and \nthe value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.<br><br>The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent \nunauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of \nencryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all \neventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty \npassword management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 \nemployees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for \nunauthorized access to the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the \nCompany deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for \nunusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or \nloss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company\u2019s products and services.",

A substantial majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding trade receivables are not \ncovered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the \nCompany\u2019s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers.

The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by \noutsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company.

            "**European Commission State Aid Decision**<br><br>On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by \nproviding tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the \nCompany (the \u201cState Aid Decision\u201d). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the \nCompany for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated \nthe application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be \u20ac13.1 billion, plus interest of \n\u20ac1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the \nEuropean Union (the \u201cGeneral Court\u201d). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, \n2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court\u2019s decision to the European Court of Justice (the \u201cECJ\u201d) and a \nhearing was held on May 23, 2023. A decision from the ECJ is expected in calendar year 2024. The Company believes it would \nbe eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to \nthe State Aid Decision.",

            "(1)\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company was authorized by the Board of Directors to purchase up to $90 billion of the \nCompany\u2019s common stock under a share repurchase program announced on May 4, 2023, of which $15.9 billion had been \nutilized. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company also utilized the final $4.6 billion under its previous repurchase \nprogram, which was most recently authorized in April 2022. The programs do not obligate the Company to acquire a \nminimum amount of shares. Under the programs, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market \ntransactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.<br><br>(2)\nIn August 2023, the Company entered into new accelerated share repurchase agreements (\u201cASRs\u201d). Under the terms of the \nASRs, two financial institutions committed to deliver shares of the Company\u2019s common stock during the purchase periods in \nexchange for up-front payments totaling $5.0 billion. The total number of shares ultimately delivered under the ASRs, and \ntherefore the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined based on the volume-weighted average price of the \nCompany\u2019s common stock during the ASRs\u2019 purchase periods, which end in the first quarter of 2024.",

Substantially all of the Company\u2019s \nmanufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South \nKorea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, \ntechnology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and supply chain and limit the Company\u2019s ability to \noffer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures \napply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply \nchain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, \nrestructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company\u2019s \noperations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and \ndisruptive to the Company\u2019s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company \nmay not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, \nincluding the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the Company\u2019s business. If \ndisputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and \nrestrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other \ninternational disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the \nCompany\u2019s business.",

Principal \ncompetitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative \nprice and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and \naccessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.<br><br>The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables \nand accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have \nsignificant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings \nwith large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products \nand a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut \nprices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products \nat little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company\u2019s services compete with business models that provide content to users for \nfree and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition \nas competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated \nsolutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.",

In addition, the \nCompany can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, \nproperty, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and \nregulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, \nand result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for \nproducts and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.",

The third performance obligation is the \nright to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with \neach device.

Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is \nbased on the Company\u2019s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized \nwhen control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped.

From time to time, the Company has made \nchanges to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory \nrequirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives \nimpacting the App Store, such as the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with \nby March 2024. The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in \nchanges to the Company\u2019s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. Changes have included how \ndevelopers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes \ncould also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside \nof the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store \nregarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company \nearns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is \notherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be \nmaterially adversely affected.",

However, the Company \nmay choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or \nprohibitive cost.<br><br>The Company applied a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of \nfluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair \nvalue, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. \nBased on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $669 \nmillion and $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively. Changes in the Company\u2019s underlying \nforeign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the \nCompany\u2019s foreign currency derivatives.",

Conclusion**<br><br>In this paper, we propose the InternLM-Xcomposer2-\n4KHD that exceeds the performance of previous open-\nsource models on OCR-related tasks and also achieves\ncompetitive results on general-purpose LVLM benchmarks.\nThanks to our dynamic resolution and automatic patch con-\nfiguration, our model supports a maximum training resolu-\ntion of up to 4K HD. We also integrate a global view patch\nto support the macro understanding and a learnable newline\ntoken to handle the various input image resolutions. Our\nmodel\u2019s performance continues to improve as the training\nresolution increases for HD-OCR tasks. Notably, we do\nnot observe any performance saturation even for the 4KHD\nsetting, and we have not explored the upper bound due to\nthe computational burden increasing with higher-resolution\ninputs. In future work, we plan to explore efficient solu-\ntions for accurate LVLM training and inference, enabling\nour model to handle even higher resolutions while main-\ntaining computational efficiency.",

Dif-\nferent from previous perception tasks (*e.g*., VQAv2, GQA)\nwhich typically answer questions based on the noticeable\nobject in the image. OCR-related tasks depend on a de-\ntailed understanding of text within a high-resolution image.\nFor instance, in InfoVQA, the length of the longer side of\n50% of the images exceeds 2000 pixels. Low-resolution\ninputs can distort the dense text information, causing the\nmodel to fail in its understanding. However, we have ob-\nserved a resolution saturation problem with the aforemen-\ntioned perception tasks, where the influence of resolution\nbecomes negligible.\nTo address this, we introduce a mixed-resolution train-\ning strategy for more efficient training. For tasks requir-\ning high resolution, we employ the \u2018HD-55\u2019 setting during\ntraining. This allows for the input of 4K (3840*\u00d7*1600) im-\nages without necessitating additional image compression.\nThese tasks are referred to as the HD-OCR QA tasks in Ta-\nble 2. For other tasks, we implement a dynamic-resolution\nstrategy. Images are resized to fall within a range between\ntheir original size and the size specified by the \u2018HD25\u2019 set-\nting. This dynamic approach enhances the robustness of the\nLVLM against differences in input resolution, thereby en-\nabling the LVLM to utilize a larger resolution during infer-\nence.",

            "**The Role of Global-View.**We first examine the impact\nof the global view in our Global-Local Format. As indi-\ncated in Table 7, we find that the global view is essential\nfor the LVLM to accurately comprehend the input image.\nWhen it is removed, the model performs worse across all\nbenchmarks. For instance, the model experiences a*\u2212*4*.*4%\ndrop in performance on the MMBench EN-Test without the\nglobal view. We contend that the global view offers a gen-\neral macro understanding of the image, which the model\nstruggled to derive from the large number of tokens in the\nlocal view.\n**The Role of the Newline Token.**We incorporate a special\nnewline token at the end of each row of the image features\nbefore the flattening operation. This token serves as an in-\ndicator of the image\u2019s 2D structure. We examine its impact\non both the HD-9 and 4KHD strategies in Table 8. When\na fixed high-resolution strategy HD-9 is employed, we ob-\nserve that the benefit derived from the newline token is mi-\nnor. This could be attributed to the LVLM\u2019s ability to handle\nlimited differences in image ratios after training. However,\nwhen we implement a more challenging 4KHD (HD-25 +\nHD-55) strategy, which exhibits significant diversity in both\nimage ratio and token number, the LVLM demonstrates a\nnotable decline in performance on OCR-related tasks with-\nout the newline indicator. This finding supports our hypoth-\nesis that the LVLM struggles to comprehend the shape of\nthe image when the image tokens are directly flattened into\na 1D sequence. The newline token can assist the model in\nbetter understanding the structure of the image.\n**Influence of Token Merging Strategy.**\nIn practice, we\nemploy a simple merging strategy that concatenates four\nadjacent tokens along the channel dimension.\n",

Alternatively, some methods [37, 46, 50, 51, 55,\n59, 99] maintain the vision encoder\u2019s resolution, segment-\ning high-resolution images into multiple low-resolution\npatches. Yet, these methods are constrained by an inad-\nequate resolution, typically around 1500*\u00d7*1500, which\ndoes not satisfy the demands of daily content,*e.g*., website\nscreenshots [85], document pages [70], and blueprints [69].\nFurthermore, they are confined to either a few predefined\nhigh-resolution settings [36, 46, 48, 50, 51, 55, 59, 66, 97]\nor a limited range of resolutions [37, 99], thereby restricting\ntheir utility across a variety of applications.\nIn this work, we introduce InternLM-XComposer2-\n4KHD, a pioneering model that for the first time expands\nthe resolution capabilities of Large Vision-Language Mod-\nels (LVLMs) to 4K HD and even higher, thereby setting\na new standard in high-resolution vision-language under-\nstanding. Designed to handle a broad range of resolutions,\nInternLM-XComposer2-4KHD supports images with any\naspect ratio from 336 pixels up to 4K HD, facilitating its\ndeployment in real-world contexts.\nInternLM-XComposer2-4KHD\nfollows\npatch\ndivi-\nsion [46, 50] paradigm and enhances it by incorporating an\ninnovative extension: dynamic resolution with automatic\npatch configuration. To be specific, scaling the resolution\nof Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to 4K HD\nand even higher standard is far beyond merely increasing\nthe number of patches. It involves a nuanced approach to\novercoming specific challenges: (1)**Dynamic Resolution**\n**and Automatic Patch Configuration**:\nAddressing the\nscarcity of high-resolution training data, our framework\n",

(2)**Handling**\n**Variability in Patch Configurations**: Despite the apparent\nsimplicity of dynamic resolution training, the variability\nin patch configurations can heavily confuse LVLMs. To\nmitigate this, we introduce a newline token after each\nrow of patch tokens to clearly delineate patch layouts,\nreducing training ambiguity and significantly boosting\nperformance.

Follow-\ning this enthusiasm, recent Large Vision-Language Mod-\nels (LVLMs) have emerged[4, 7, 16, 18, 19, 25, 28, 32,\n47, 74, 77, 102, 110, 113], combining LLMs with vi-\nsion encoders [79, 89, 109] to leverage the complemen-\ntary strengths of language and vision modalities. By fusing\ntextual and visual representations, LVLMs can ground lan-\nguage in visual contexts, enabling a more comprehensive\nunderstanding and generation of multimodal content [5, 11,\n14, 20, 27, 51, 60, 95].\n**LVLMs for High-Resolution Understanding.**\nLarge\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs) often employ CLIP-\nViT as the visual encoder for vision-dependent tasks. How-\never, the visual encoder\u2019s reliance on low resolutions,\nsuch as 224*\u00d7*224 or 336*\u00d7*336 pixels, limits its ef-\nfectiveness for high-resolution tasks like OCR and docu-\nment/chart perception. To enhance high-resolution under-\nstanding, recent works have primarily employed the fol-\nlowing strategies: (1) High-resolution (HR) visual encoders\nor dual encoders catering to HR and low-resolution (LR)\ninputs [36, 48, 66, 97].\nFor instance, Vary [97] intro-\nduces a new image encoder supporting HR inputs, which\n",

Take Action for Better Access <br><br>In many communities, fruits and vegetables are limited/expensive and only \navailable in corner stores, convenience stores, bodegas and gas stations. <br><br>Lack of access can profoundly impact diet. Here's how: Contact your city and \nstate leaders to let them know what food access is in your community.",

This underscores the capacity for further en-\nhancing model capabilities and suggests a promising tra-\njectory for advancing the frontiers of high-resolution image\nprocessing within the domain of large vision-language mod-\nels.\nWe evaluate our InternLM-XComposer2-4KHD on\n16 diverse benchmarks spanning various domains, in-\ncluding 5 challenging HD-OCR datasets (DocVQA[70],\nChartQA[68],\nInfographicVQA[69],\nTextVQA[87] and\nOCRBench[58]).\nCompared to previous open-source\nLVLM models and closed-source APIs, our approach\nachieves SOTA results in 6 of 16 benchmarks, demon-\nstrating competitive performance despite only 7B parame-\nters. As shown in Figure 1, InternLM-XComposer2-4KHD\neven surpasses the performance of GPT4V [74] and Gemini\nPro [90] across ten benchmarks. Notably, our method ex-\nhibits excellent performance on 5 HD-OCR datasets, over\nexisting open-source LVLMs by a substantial margin.",
