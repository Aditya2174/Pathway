      "Successful completion of a transaction involves exchange of merchandise with payment. The buyer has to be satisfied he/she received what they thought they were getting and the seller has to be sure he/she gets paid. i-Escrow holds payment from the buyer in trust until the seller sends the merchandise to the buyer. Once the buyer accepts the merchandise, i-Escrow forwards the payment to the seller by writing a check.  A typical escrow transaction: When an auction ends, your end of auction email contains links to i-Escrow. Once you have signed up with i-Escrow   you go through the following steps to complete your transaction. 1.   Start a transaction by entering the description and price of the merchandise along with email address of the other party. 2.   The other party receives an email from i-Escrow requesting an acknowledgement of the terms of the transaction. 3.   Once the transaction is acknowledged by the other party, the buyer pays i-Escrow the agreed upon price, by credit card or other means. 4.   i-Escrow informs the seller that payment has been received, requesting them to ship the merchandise directly to the buyer. 5.   The seller provides i-Escrow with the tracking number of the shipment. 6.   The buyer receives and accepts the merchandise. 7.   i-Escrow sends the check to the seller.\n",

As set forth herein, 2TheMart will promote Services to its auction users (buyers and sellers), and i-Escrow shall develop Co-Branded Site, and develop the Information Transfer Mechanism working with 2TheMart to make Services available seamlessly to Customers. Unless otherwise specified, each party shall be responsible for all development, hosting and other costs associated with the pages resident on their servers and all emails to users they send.\n",
      "2.2 INITIAL INFORMATION TRANSFER MECHANISM DEVELOPMENT. The parties shall negotiate in good faith to determine the initial operation of the Information Transfer Mechanism and to describe such operation and development fees, in a statement of work (\"SOW\"). Each party shall make available sufficient and qualified engineers to negotiate the SOW. No SOW shall be binding on the parties unless mutually approved by both parties. In the event that the parties are unable to agree to an SOW within 2 months following the Effective Date, either party may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement by providing written notice.\n",
      "Once approved, the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to diligently implement their respective obligations under the SOW.

Each party shall reasonably cooperate with the other party in effectuating their respective duties under the SOW. The Information Transfer Mechanism shall not go live until its operation has been approved (\"Approval Date\") by both parties, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld.\n",
      "2.3 LAUNCH TIMING. Each party shall use good faith and reasonable efforts to expeditiously develop the Co-Branded Pages and the Information Transfer Mechanism. In the event that, after using such efforts, the Launch Date has not occurred within 4 months following the Effective Date, either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice. If\n",
      "only one party has used good faith and reasonable development efforts, only that party may exercise the foregoing right to terminate.\n",
      "2.4 RESTRICTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS. i-Escrow may place banner advertising on the Co-Branded Site upon prior written approval of 2TheMart, which shall be at the discretion of 2TheMart. All advertising revenue arising from the banner ads shall be solely i-Escrow's. i-Escrow shall not run banner advertisements on the Co-Branded Site for any of 2TheMart's competitors. 2TheMart shall provide in writing, a list of companies they would like to exclude, including every time they wish to change this list.\n",

      "ESCROW SERVICES DESCRIPTION\n",
      "Successful completion of a transaction involves exchange of merchandise with payment. The buyer has to be satisfied he/she received what they thought they were getting and the seller has to be sure he/she gets paid. i-Escrow holds payment from the buyer in trust until the seller sends the merchandise to the buyer. Once the buyer accepts the merchandise, i-Escrow forwards the payment to the seller by writing a check. A typical escrow transaction: When an auction ends, your end of auction email contains links to i-Escrow. Once you have signed up with i-Escrow you go through the following steps to complete your transaction. 1. Start a transaction by entering the description and price of the merchandise along with email address of the other party. 2. The other party receives an email from i-Escrow requesting an acknowledgement of the terms of the transaction. 3. Once the transaction is acknowledged by the other party, the buyer pays i-Escrow the agreed upon price, by credit card or other means. 4. i-Escrow informs the seller that payment has been received, requesting them to ship the merchandise directly to the buyer. 5. The seller provides i-Escrow with the tracking number of the shipment. 6. The buyer receives and accepts the merchandise. 7. i-Escrow sends the check to the seller.\n",
